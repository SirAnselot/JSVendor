# JSVendor
JavaScript-Vendor collection with script to compile a custom selection of frameworks in one .min.js to keep page-requests in projects under control. The collection should grow as other frameworks turn out as indispensable and new stable versions are released. Older Versions are kept to quickly turn back to, if incompatibilities in custom combinations of a project occure.
